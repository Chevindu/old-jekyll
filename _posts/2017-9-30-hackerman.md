No seriously, this is sort of a big deal for me. These fancy terms are still uncanny for me and I'm still tweaking with the stuff; but I'm happy that I'm here and would like to thank internet for that.

I'm going to keep the this short. Next goal is to successfully run Google Fonts on Jekyll and I will most probably write about it, if I get it right.

Viva la blogging!

UPDATE: Nailed the Google Fonts thingy. Now we can read සිංහල in style.
